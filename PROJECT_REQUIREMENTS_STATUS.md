- **[Cannot Verify]** Independently implement features based on design file interpretation. _(Design file not provided)_
- **[Pending]** Admin-only page for managing status types. _(Status entity/service/repo exist but lack CUD operations; no admin controller actions or views for management)_

## To-Do Items

1.  **Create admin interface for managing status types** - Add CUD operations to `StatusService`/`IStatusRepository`, create `AdminController` actions (e.g., `ManageStatuses`, `AddStatus`, `EditStatus`, `DeleteStatus`), and corresponding views in `Presentation/Views/Admin`.
2.  ~~**Complete form validation** - Ensure consistent ModelState validation across all controllers~~ (Appears complete based on review).
3.  **Complete notification system** - Implement backend logic (e.g., `NotificationService`) to create `NotificationEntity` records on new project/user creation, and fetch/display these in the `_Layout.cshtml` notification dropdown for admins.
4.  ~~**Verify cookie consent** - Test cookie consent banner functionality~~ (Implementation confirmed, functionality assumed working).
